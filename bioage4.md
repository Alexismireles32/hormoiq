Hormonal “Bioage” Reference for Cortisol, Testosterone, and Progesterone
Cortisol: Diurnal Pattern and Age Trends

Cortisol levels follow a strong diurnal rhythm. In healthy individuals, cortisol spikes shortly after waking (the cortisol awakening response) and then declines throughout the day to a low point around bedtime
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. For example, salivary cortisol may peak within an hour of awakening and fall to a nadir roughly 16 hours later
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This daily cycle is present across ages; however, aging affects baseline cortisol levels modestly. After adolescence, adult cortisol output remains relatively stable through mid-life, then tends to rise slightly in older adulthood
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. One large meta-analysis (over 18,000 individuals) found that cortisol levels in seniors were higher than in younger adults – increasing by about 2% per decade after age ~50, so that 70–80 year-olds had ~18% higher daily cortisol than the adult average
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In concrete terms, median morning cortisol (~1 hour after waking) is around 6–7 nmol/L for 30–40 year-old adults, rising to around 7–8 nmol/L in 70–80 year-olds (and about 8–9 nmol/L in those over 80)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Sex differences in cortisol are relatively small. Overall, men have roughly ~3% higher salivary cortisol than women of the same age
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. However, there are nuanced age interactions: in youth (pre-puberty and adolescence), boys show slightly lower cortisol levels than girls, while in older ages the pattern reverses
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Notably, older men exhibit the age-related cortisol increase about a decade earlier than women – men begin to show rising cortisol in their 50s, whereas women tend to see that increase in their 60s
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In summary, a “normal” cortisol profile for bio-age assessment should account for the daily peak/trough cycle and the slight elevation of cortisol in advanced age. A person with unusually high cortisol in the evening or a blunted daily decline might have a stress-related dysregulation, but if an older individual’s overall cortisol output is somewhat higher, that can be consistent with typical aging
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. (For algorithm purposes, ensure the comparison uses age-adjusted diurnal reference ranges – e.g. comparing a 8 AM cortisol to the average 8 AM level for that age and sex group.)

Testosterone: Age-Related Decline in Men and Women

Testosterone levels decline steadily with age in both sexes. Salivary testosterone (representing free, bioactive hormone) peaks in late adolescence/early adulthood and then gradually falls over the adult lifespan
researchgate.net
. In men, mean salivary testosterone drops from about 322.6 pmol/L at age 18 down to about 153.9 pmol/L by age 69
researchgate.net
. This corresponds to roughly a 50% reduction (an average decline on the order of ~1.0–1.4% per year)
researchgate.net
. In practical units, 322.6 pmol/L is approximately 90–95 pg/mL, versus ~45 pg/mL at 69 years – a substantial difference. Women’s testosterone is much lower in absolute terms (about one-sixth that of males on average
researchgate.net
), but women also show an age-related decline. The geometric mean salivary testosterone for women falls from around 39.8 pmol/L at age 18 to 19.5 pmol/L by age 74
researchgate.net
 – roughly a 1.3–1.5% per year decline, similar in proportional rate to men. By midlife and beyond, many women have very low salivary testosterone; indeed, the bottom 2.5th percentile of women’s levels becomes undetectable in assays after about age 52 (post-menopausal age)
researchgate.net
. Despite the decline with age, the male–female gap in testosterone remains constant – adult men’s Sal-T levels are about 6 times higher than women’s at any age
researchgate.net
 (e.g. a 40-year-old man vs woman will reflect this ratio, as will a 70-year-old pair).

Diurnal profile: Testosterone exhibits a daily rhythm as well, peaking in the early morning and dipping by evening – though this effect is more pronounced in younger men. For instance, in healthy men ~30–40 years old, late-afternoon total testosterone is about 20–25% lower than the morning level
agelessforever.net
. As men age, the diurnal fluctuation flattens: by about 70 years old, the difference between 8 AM and 4 PM testosterone may be only ~10%
agelessforever.net
. In fact, studies note that the typical morning surge seen in young men can be markedly blunted or absent in older men
agelessforever.net
. For women, daily fluctuations in testosterone are smaller, but some premenopausal women show higher levels in morning as well. Algorithm implications: When interpreting a salivary testosterone result, it’s important to consider the time of collection and the person’s age/sex. A young man’s level should be compared to young male morning averages, whereas an older man’s “normal” level will be lower (and an afternoon sample for an older man might still be representative). In summary, assigning a testosterone bio-age involves matching the individual’s Sal-T concentration to age-specific reference distributions. For example, a 45-year-old man with a saliva testosterone of, say, 100 pg/mL (≈350 pmol/L) would be well above the typical average for his age (which might be closer to 70–80 pg/mL), suggesting a “younger” hormonal age. Conversely, a 30-year-old man with only 50 pg/mL Sal-T might have the hormonal profile of a much older man

Progesterone: Female Cycles, Menopause, and Age Differences

Progesterone levels are highly dependent on sex and (for women) the reproductive stage. Premenopausal women have cyclical progesterone production: in each menstrual cycle, progesterone is low in the follicular phase and then surges after ovulation during the luteal phase. In young adult women (ages ~18–30), average salivary progesterone is about 80 pg/mL in the follicular phase (early cycle) and rises to roughly 130 pg/mL at mid-luteal peak
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
. Individual variation is large, but these represent typical means for healthy ovulating women. By contrast, postmenopausal women (who no longer ovulate) have consistently low progesterone levels. Salivary progesterone in postmenopausal females (age ~50–70) has been reported around 50–60 pg/mL on average
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
, which is less than half the luteal-phase level of a younger woman. This reflects the loss of ovarian progesterone output after menopause. In other words, a postmenopausal 60-year-old might only reach ~60 pg/mL at “peak” (which in her case comes from adrenal sources or peripheral conversion), whereas a 30-year-old could produce over 100 pg/mL during her cycle’s peak
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
. Thus, a very low progesterone reading in a woman often indicates either a non-ovulatory phase or menopausal status, corresponding to an older hormonal age. Conversely, robust luteal progesterone suggests a reproductive-age hormonal profile.

It’s important to note that even among premenopausal women, age influences progesterone. Interestingly, research has found that women in their prime reproductive years (mid-20s through 30s) tend to have higher luteal progesterone levels on average than both younger women and those nearing menopause
fertstert.org
. One study stratifying ages showed the highest luteal progesterone in the 25–39 year group, while the 18–24 and 40–48 year groups had lower values – the median luteal progesterone for the younger and older groups was about equivalent to the 25th percentile of the middle group
fertstert.org
. This suggests a slight U-shaped relationship, where late teens (who may still be maturing hormonally) and perimenopausal women (whose ovulatory function is declining) have more cycles with suboptimal progesterone, whereas women around their late 20s-30s have the most consistently high luteal progesterone
fertstert.org
. In practice, this means a 22-year-old and a 45-year-old might both exhibit modest luteal progesterone compared to a 30-year-old, despite the age difference. For algorithm design, it would be wise to use age-specific female progesterone norms, especially if interpreting a mid-luteal sample. For example, a luteal saliva progesterone of 130 pg/mL might be average for a 30-year-old, high for a 20-year-old, and perhaps above average for a 45-year-old. If the goal is a single “progesterone bio-age,” one might map the person’s level to the age group where that level is median. Additionally, one must account for cycle timing: a premenopausal woman in her follicular phase will naturally have low progesterone (akin to a much older or prepubertal profile) – this does not indicate an older bioage if it’s simply due to cycle day. Ideally, comparisons are made at equivalent cycle phases (e.g. compare luteal-phase levels to luteal-phase norms by age)
fertstert.org
fertstert.org
.

Men vs. women: Males have no cyclic progesterone surges – their progesterone comes from adrenal and testicular sources at a low, steady level. Young adult men tend to have saliva progesterone in the range of only ~20–30 pg/mL with minimal daily variation
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
. This level is similar to a woman’s baseline during menstruation or early follicular phase. Importantly, men do not experience an age-related progesterone drop as dramatic as women’s (since men start low and stay low). There is relatively scant data on men’s progesterone vs age, but generally adult men maintain low stable progesterone, possibly with a slight decline in very old age. For the bioage algorithm, a man’s progesterone result would be interpreted on a different scale than a woman’s. If a man shows significantly elevated progesterone (outside the normal male range), it could indicate exogenous sources or adrenal issues rather than a “younger” profile. For women, however, higher progesterone (when appropriately timed in the cycle) indicates a more youthful, ovulatory hormonal status, whereas consistently low progesterone (especially if not on hormonal birth control and tested mid-luteal) might indicate an older or ovarian-insufficient profile
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
.

Summary and Implementation for Bioage Algorithm

In summary, each hormone has characteristic age trajectories: cortisol remains relatively stable until later life with a slight uptick in the elderly
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
; testosterone steadily declines with age in both men and women (men dropping about half by their 60s; women also roughly halved by postmenopausal years)
researchgate.net
; and progesterone in women dramatically falls at menopause (with mid-life women showing the highest luteal values, and younger or older women lower)
fertstert.org
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
. Men’s progesterone stays low throughout. All these measurements are best interpreted in context – time of day for cortisol and testosterone (due to diurnal cycles) and menstrual cycle phase for female progesterone (due to ovulatory cycles).

When configuring your bioage algorithm, use age- and sex-specific reference data derived from salivary hormone studies to map a user’s hormone levels to an equivalent “hormonal age.” For example:

If a 40-year-old woman’s 8 AM cortisol and daily pattern match what is typical for 40-year-olds, her cortisol bioage is 40. If her cortisol is significantly higher than the norm for her age (but comparable to an average 55-year-old’s level), the algorithm might flag an “older” cortisol age
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Conversely, unusually low cortisol (or a strong youthful diurnal slope) could indicate a younger stress profile – though caution that too-low cortisol might also signal adrenal dysfunction.

For testosterone, if a man’s saliva testosterone is, say, 120 pg/mL in the morning, and that level is average for men in their late 20s, his testosterone bioage would be ~28 (even if he is older)
researchgate.net
. If a 30-year-old man only has 50 pg/mL (more typical of a man in his 70s), his testosterone bioage might be decades older. Women’s low absolute T means the algorithm should compare within female norms – e.g. a postmenopausal woman with 7 pmol/L (which is normal for her age) is “on track,” but if a 30-year-old had 7 pmol/L that would be far below her peers
researchgate.net
.

For progesterone, ensure the comparison is phase-appropriate. Ideally use a mid-luteal sample for premenopausal women. Then, if a 35-year-old woman’s luteal progesterone is, for instance, 120 pg/mL, that’s around the median for her age group (biologically ~35). If only 50 pg/mL at luteal peak, that might correspond to the lower 5th percentile for her age – perhaps equivalent to a much older (or anovulatory) profile
fertstert.org
. In postmenopausal women or men (who have no luteal phase), low values are expected and their “bioage” for progesterone would simply reflect that they are in a non-reproductive hormonal state (e.g. a man or a menopausal woman effectively has a progesterone age of >50 by default, unless on supplementation).

By grounding the algorithm in these research-based reference ranges, you can provide users with a meaningful hormonal age indicator. In essence, you’ll be comparing their hormone results to the average levels seen in various ages:

Cortisol: mild increase in later years (consider diurnal curve shape and overall output)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Testosterone: steady decline with age in both sexes (men’s level ~50% of young by 70s; women’s very low after menopause)
researchgate.net
.

Progesterone: women have high levels only during reproductive years’ luteal phase, dropping to low baseline after menopause
biomarkers.uchicago.edu
 (men always low).

All these factors should be built into the algorithm so that it can “decree perfectly the hormonal age” from the saliva test results, taking into account the user’s sex, actual age, time of sampling, and (for women) cycle status. Using the latest studies and reference data will ensure the bioage calculation is scientifically sound and reflects true physiological averages for each age group
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
researchgate.net
. With this approach, the bioage feature can accurately contrast a user’s hormonal profile with what is expected at their calendar age, highlighting where they may appear hormonally “younger” or “older” than their actual age.
