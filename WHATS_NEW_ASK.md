## 🔥 Example Conversations

### New User
**User:** *taps "How do I get started with testing?"*

**AI:** Since you're just getting started, I'd recommend testing your cortisol first thing in the morning. Cortisol naturally peaks 30-60 minutes after waking, making it easy to establish your baseline. Once you've done 3-5 tests over different days, we can start identifying patterns.

**Suggested Questions:**
- What time should I test in the morning?
- How often should I test cortisol?
- What should I track along with tests?

---

### Experienced User
**User:** *taps "What do my recent test results mean?"*

**AI:** Looking at your last 5 tests, your cortisol has been consistently between 14-16 ng/mL, which is optimal for your age (32M). What's interesting is the correlation I'm seeing: on days you rated sleep 4/5 or better, your cortisol averaged 14.2, but on 3/5 sleep days, it jumped to 16.8. This 18% difference is significant and suggests sleep quality is a key lever for you.

**Suggested Questions:**
- How can I improve my sleep quality?
- What's causing my elevated cortisol?
- Should I try the sleep protocol?
